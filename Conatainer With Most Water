Given N non-negative integers a1,a2,....an where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai).
N vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i,0).
Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that it contains the most water.

Note : In Case of single verticle line it will not be able to hold water.

long long maxArea(long long A[], int len)
{
    long long ans=0;
    int low=0;
    int high=len-1;
    while(low<high)
    {  
        ans=max(ans,min(A[low],A[high])*(high-low));
        if(A[low]<=A[high]) low++;
        else high--;
    }
    return ans;
}

Main Aim is to change the pivot index of lower element to check for the maximum area.
