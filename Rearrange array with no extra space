Given an array arr[] of size N where every element is in the range from 0 to n-1. 
Rearrange the given array so that arr[i] becomes arr[arr[i]].

New element become = (arr[arr[i]%n)*n;
new element become the remainder part and we multiply the remainder to make count the new element.
Example:
new element =3;
n=5;
  so,
  3%5=3;
  and 3*5=15, thus when we need to calulate the new element then we just divide the new elemwnt by n.
 
 To store the element we add the old element with new calculated value because all the element must be less than n;
 so no elemnt can be summed up to new multiply of n.
 so we just get that element by again remainder of stored element.
 
 
 void arrange(long long arr[], int n) {
        int i;
     
        for(i=0;i<n;i++){
            arr[i]+=(arr[arr[i]]%n)*n;
            cout<<arr[i]<<" ";
        }

        for(i=0;i<n;i++){
            arr[i]=arr[i]/n;
        }
    }
